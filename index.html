<h1> This is a heading. Headings like this should give a general idea of the paragraph. </h1>
  <p> And this is a paragraph. Paragraphs like this one can be used to present information and elaborate your heading. These paragraphs follow all the grammatical rules of a normal paragraph that would be written by hand. </p>
  <b> In some paragraphs, the text can be customized; for example, this text is bolded. </b>
  <I> While this text is in italics. </i>
  <p> Pictures can also be added. For example, have a look at this cute cat. </p>

  <p> Visual representation is important, but pictures are only one of the ways they can be viewed on a website; YouTube videos are also common. Now look at this video of a cute cat.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlDtL2hIj-Q?si=RhkNmY2mD3ZOQpvi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Information can also be put into graphs on a website, for example, look at these different cat breeds: </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> British Shorthair</li>
    <li> Maine Coon </li>
    <li> Munchkin</li>
    <li> Scottish Fold</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The list above is considered unordered, but there can also be ordered lists. Now look at this list of what a cat needs to survive:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Water </li>
    <li> Cat Food</li>
    <li> Enrichment </li>
    <li> A Litter Box </li>
    <li> Exercise </li>
  </ol>
